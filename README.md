Bottleboat

02:24 - Jack: Added first version of our bottle-boat's programming to the repository, it has a basic layout at the moment to get us started and I'll add more to it every night as I get more solutions. Need some help with certain things like using double floats and structs, as well as getting started on how we're going to implement GPS, rudder, and some other functionality into the code. Once someone helps start me off with those I should be able to finish them off.

02:27 - Jack: Also, I'm not 100% on how GitHub handles files and versions/backups but I named the program with "v1" to indicate it as the first version, so that's why that's there. But that can be changed any time anyway so whatevs. Next thing for me is to talk to our mentor and figure out what's wrong with the compass library implementation, then start work on the GPS function.

12:12 - Jack: Cleaned up the repository a bit; removed some temporary and redundant files. Bottle-boat code's coming along nicely, almost finished, just have to work on the GPS and rudder some more then do some testing. Physically the boat may need some improvements, a guy from SailBot mentioned that the compass may get some interference if it's too close to the other components, so we should look into this and do some testing (and find a solution if needed) before the comeptition.
